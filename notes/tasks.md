Low-Level MCU progamming 
Learn: 
    - Embedded C basics 
    - Register and bitwise operations 
    - GPIO input/output 
    - Timers and delay functions
    - Interrupts (button interrupt, timer interrupt)
    0 Debouncing and edge detection 
blinking led with:
    - delay loop, timer interrupt, button interrupt 

Peripherals & communication
Learn:  
    - Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC)
    - Pulse with Modulation (PWM)
    - Serial communication: UART, SPI, I2C
    - basics of sensors: temperature, light, distance 
    - 7-segment displays
Practice:
    - read analog, motor / servo with PWM, send serial output to PC using UART, I2C OLED displays
